# The IP Address Tracker project is a web application that allows users to input an IP address and receive information about its location and other details.

## As a developer, I was responsible for implementing the frontend of the application using React.js. This included creating the user interface and implementing the logic for handling user input and displaying the results.

## I utilized the API provided by the project to fetch the location data for a given IP address and display it on the page. I also implemented error handling to display appropriate messages when the API call fails or the input is invalid.

## I also worked on the UI design and made it responsive and mobile friendly.

## I also wrote test cases to ensure that the application functions as expected and also added some error handling to make sure the application handles all the edge cases.

## Overall, I was able to create a functional and user-friendly IP Address Tracker application that allows users to easily input and receive information about an IP address.
